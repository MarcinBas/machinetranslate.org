The **Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation** (**AAMT**) is comprised of researchers, manufacturers and users of machine translation systems.
The association is engaged in machine translation system development, improvement, education, and publicity.

The AAMT is one of three regional associations of the International Association for Machine Translation \([IAMT](iamt.md)\).
Its sister associations are the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas \([AMTA](amta.md)\) and the European Association for Machine Translation \([EAMT](eamt.md)\).
Members of any of the three regional associations automatically become part of the IAMT network.

The AAMT was established as the *Japan Machine Translation Association* in 1991 and renamed to the *Asia-Pacific Machine Translation Association* in 1992.
